# OCR Text Extraction Task - Complete Implementation

## Overview

I have successfully created a comprehensive OCR (Optical Character Recognition) task based on the shapecount task structure. This task is designed to test 5 different agents on their ability to extract text from various types of images with different difficulty levels and challenges.

## Task Structure

The OCR task follows the same structure as the shapecount task:

```
ocr_task/
├── __init__.py                 # Package initialization
├── config.json                 # Task configuration
├── prompt.md                   # Task description for agents
├── evaluator.py               # Evaluation logic
├── generate_inputs.py         # Input image generator
├── requirements.txt           # Dependencies
├── ground_truth_text.json     # Ground truth data
├── README.md                  # Documentation
├── test_task.py              # Test script
└── TASK_SUMMARY.md           # This summary
```

## Key Features

### 1. **Multi-Difficulty Text Images**
- **Easy**: Clean, high-contrast text with standard fonts
- **Medium**: Mixed fonts, slight rotations, basic noise
- **Hard**: Complex layouts, significant noise, rotated text, handwritten styles

### 2. **Various Image Types**
- Clean printed text
- Handwritten text (cursive, print, mixed styles)
- Rotated text (various angles)
- Low resolution/blurry text
- Document-style formatted text
- Noisy images with different noise levels
- Mixed fonts and sizes

### 3. **Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics**
- **Text Similarity**: Overall similarity using difflib SequenceMatcher
- **Character Accuracy**: Character-level accuracy
- **Word Accuracy**: Word-level accuracy
- **Average Confidence**: Mean confidence score across predictions
- **Successful Extractions**: Count of images with >50% text similarity

### 4. **Agent Testing Capabilities**
The task tests agents on:
- Traditional OCR tools (Tesseract, EasyOCR)
- Image preprocessing skills
- Multi-language support
- Robustness across image qualities
- Confidence score calibration

## Configuration

The task is configured with:
- **Task ID**: `ocr_text_extraction`
- **Difficulty**: `medium`
- **Category**: `computer_vision`
- **Timeout**: 600 seconds
- **Accuracy Threshold**: 0.8 (80%)

## Output Format

Agents must produce a `solution.json` file with:

```json
{
  "predictions": {
    "image_1.png": {
      "text": "Extracted text content",
      "confidence": 0.95
    },
    "image_2.png": {
      "text": "Another text sample", 
      "confidence": 0.87
    }
  }
}
```

## Ground Truth Data

The task includes 15 sample images with ground truth text covering:
- Simple phrases ("Hello World", "Welcome to OCR")
- Medium complexity sentences
- Complex paragraphs with technical content
- Various difficulty levels and image types

## Usage Instructions

### For Testing Agents:

1. **Provide the task folder** to each of the 5 agents
2. **Agents should read** `prompt.md` for task instructions
3. **Agents process** the input images (when generated)
4. **Agents output** `solution.json` with their predictions
5. **Run evaluation** using the evaluator to compare against ground truth

### For Generating Test Images:

```bash
python generate_inputs.py --out . --n 15 --size 512
```

### For Testing Task Structure:

```bash
python test_task.py
```

## Dependencies

- Pillow (PIL) - Image processing
- pytesseract - OCR engine
- opencv-python - Computer vision
- numpy - Numerical operations
- difflib - Text similarity (built-in)

## Evaluation Process

1. Load agent's `solution.json` predictions
2. Load ground truth from `ground_truth_text.json`
3. Calculate multiple similarity metrics
4. Determine success based on accuracy threshold
5. Generate comprehensive performance report

## Comparison with ShapeCount Task

| Aspect | ShapeCount | OCR Task |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **Input** | Geometric shapes | Text images |
| **Output** | Integer counts | Text + confidence |
| **Evaluation** | Exact count match | Text similarity |
| **Complexity** | Visual counting | Text extraction + preprocessing |
| **Tools** | Image analysis | OCR engines + NLP |

## Ready for Agent Testing

The OCR task is now complete and ready for testing with 5 different agents. Each agent will be evaluated on their ability to:

1. **Extract text accurately** from various image types
2. **Handle different challenges** (rotation, noise, handwriting)
3. **Provide realistic confidence scores**
4. **Process multiple languages and fonts**
5. **Apply appropriate preprocessing techniques**

The task provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating OCR capabilities across different approaches and tools.
